### Project Title
Investigate a Relational Database with PostgreSQL


### Description
This project i try to solve below questionnaires by SQL.

**Question 1**
We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching.
The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists each movie, 
the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.


**Question 2**
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies
compares to the duration that all movies are rented for.

Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels
(first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter)
based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories?
Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into

**Question 3**
provide a table with the family-friendly film category,
each of the quartiles,
and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category.

**Question 4**
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for.
Write a query that returns the store ID for the store,
the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month.

**Question 5**
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, 
how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, 
and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, 
month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?
